# LL(K) Grammars Support

Chevrotain can be used to build parsers for [LL(K)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LL_grammar) Grammars.
This means that the number of lookahead tokens needed to disambiguate two alternatives must
be a fixed number and known in advance.

For example given the grammar

```antlr
statement:
   A B C |
   A B D |
   A B E
```

Chevrotain will look **three** tokens ahead to decide between the two alternatives.

But given the following grammar

```antlr
statement:
   longRule B  |
   longRule C  |
   longRule D

longRule:
   A+
```

Chevrotain will throw a an error during the parser initialization in this case.
This is because there is no fixed number of tokens we can use to choose between the alternatives
that is due to a potentially **infinite** number of "A" tokens that can appear before the "B" - "C" tokens.
