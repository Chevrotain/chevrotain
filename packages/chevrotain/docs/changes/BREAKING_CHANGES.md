## 6.0.0

-   Due to re-implementation of the grammar analysis via ["grammar recording"](../guide/internals.md#grammar-recording), certain semantics action
    will now need to be wrapped in the new [ACTION](https://sap.github.io/chevrotain/documentation/6_0_0/classes/baseparser.html#action) Parsing
    DSL method. This will not affect Parsers that output a CST and only affect some of the Parsers which employ embedded semantic actions.
    The Missing `ACTION` wrappers will be automatically detected and throw a descriptive error message to ease migration.

-   Grammar de-serialization support has been removed as it is now redundant as Chevrotain no longer relies on `Function.prototype.toString`.
    And the de-serialization feature was a workaround to issues caused by `Function.prototype.toString`.
    This means the [serializedGrammar property](https://sap.github.io/chevrotain/documentation/5_0_0/interfaces/iparserconfig.html#serializedgrammar)
    of the Parser's configuration was removed, and using it will cause an error to be thrown during initialization.

-   The Parser's [getGAstProductions method](https://sap.github.io/chevrotain/documentation/6_0_0/classes/baseparser.html#getgastproductions)
    now returns a plain JavaScript object representing a Map/Dictionary rather than the Chevrotain's internal HashTable implementation.

## 5.0.0

-   Setting the Parser's input **before** `this.performSelfAnalysis` is called will now throw an error.
    This limitation is necessary in order to enable to enable the automatic detection of missing `this.performSelfAnalysis` calls.
    To avoid this issue do **not** pass the input token vector input to the Parser's constructor and instead always set the input
    after the Parser instance was created, This pattern is demonstrated in the tutorial:
    -   [Parser Constructor Structure.](../tutorial/step2_parsing.md#structure)
    -   [Setting the Token Vector Input.](../tutorial/step2_parsing.md#usage)

## 4.0.0

-   The Parser constructor no longer accepts a token vector as an argument.
    The "input" **setter** should be used instead, for example:

    ```javascript
    // Old API
    class MyOldParser extends Parser {
        constructor(input, config) {
            super(input, allTokens, config)
        }
    }

    const oldInstance = new MyOldParser(
        [
            /* token vector */
        ],
        {}
    )

    // New API
    class MyNewParser extends Parser {
        constructor(config) {
            super(allTokens, config)
        }
    }

    const newInstance = new MyNewParser({})
    newInstance.input = [
        /* token vector */
    ]
    ```

    -   Note that the input **setter** has existed for a while and has been used
        in the official examples and documentation, therefore it is likely that
        only the constructor need be modified in existing parsers.

-   Automatic [Concrete Syntax Tree](https://sap.github.io/chevrotain/docs/guide/concrete_syntax_tree.html) output is now enabled by default.
    This means that parser which rely on **embedded actions** must **explicitly** disable
    the CST output, for example:

    ```javascript
    class MyNewParser extends Parser {
        constructor() {
            // we have to explicitly disable the CST building for embedded actions to work.
            super(allTokens, { outputCst: false })
        }
    }
    ```

    -   If a parser already uses CST output no change is needed in 4.0

-   DSL repetitions no longer return any values in **embedded actions** mode:

    -   **MANY** / **AT_LEAST_ONE** no longer return an array of the iteration results.
        The iterations results should be collected manually instead:

        ```javascript
        // Before 4.0.0
        const stmts = $.MANY(() => {
            return $.SUBRULE(Statement)
        })

        // After 4.0.0
        const stmts = []
        $.MANY(() => {
            stmts.push($.SUBRULE(Statement))
        })
        ```

    -   Similarly **MANY_SEP** / **AT_LEAST_ONE_SEP** also no longer return any results.
        These used to return both the repetition result array and an array of separators Tokens consumed.
        It is still possible to manually collect the repetition results, but not the separator tokens.

    -   This change has no effect when using automatic **CST creation**.

## 3.0.0

-   A CST Node's children dictionary no longer contains empty arrays
    for unmatched terminals and non-terminals. This means that some existence checks
    conditions in the CST visitor must be refactored, for example:

    ```javascript
    class MyVisitor extends SomeBaseVisitor {
        atomicExpression(ctx) {
            // BAD - will fail due to "TypeError: Cannot read property '0' of undefined"
            if (ctx.Integer[0]) {
                return ctx.Integer[0].image
            }

            // GOOD - safe check
            if (ctx.Integer) {
                // if a property exists it's value is guaranteed to have at least one element.
                return ctx.Identifier[0].image
            }
        }
    }
    ```

## 2.0.0

-   The creation of TokenTypes using the class keyword syntax has been soft deprecated.
    and is no longer officially supported.
    e.g:

    ```javascript
    // No longer officially supported
    class Identifier {
        static pattern = /[a-zA-Z_]\w+/
    }

    // Use the createToken API instead
    const Identifier = createToken({
        name: "Identifier",
        pattern: /[a-zA-Z_]\w+/
    })
    ```

    See the reasoning in [this issue](https://github.com/SAP/chevrotain/issues/653).

*   defaultErrorProvider was renamed to defaultParserErrorProvider

*   **All** the gast namespace was flattened into the API's root, e.g:

    ```javascript
    // Old API - using nested namespace.
    chevrotain.gast.Alternation

    // New API - No nested namespaces.
    chevrotain.Alternation
    ```

*   The exceptions namespace was also flattened into the API's root.

*   The constructors of all the gast (Grammar AST) structure have been
    refactored to use the config object pattern additionally some properties have been renamed or removed.
