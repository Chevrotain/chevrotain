# Introduction

## Installation

```shell
yarn add chevrotain
# OR
npm install chevrotain
```

## Scenario

In this tutorial we will implement a parser for a simplified SQL syntax which will contain only SELECT statements.
The output of the parser will be an Abstract Syntax Tree (AST).

## Running & Debugging

The code snippets in this tutorial steps are part of an
executable and debuggable [example](https://github.com/chevrotain/chevrotain/tree/master/examples/tutorial).
It is recommended to use these sources either as an initial template
or as an executable example in order to gain a deeper understanding.

## Samples Syntax

This tutorial uses ES2015+ syntax.
See examples of how to use Chevrotain with other [implementation languages](https://github.com/chevrotain/chevrotain/tree/master/examples/implementation_languages).
