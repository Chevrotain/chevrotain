# Blazing Fast

Chevrotain treats performance as a feature, not as a secondary concern.
This means that a great deal of work has gone into profiling and optimization with a focus on the [V8 JavaScript engine](https://github.com/v8/v8/wiki).
It also means that new features are considered in terms of performance cost.

The result of this effort is that Chevrotain is **Blazing Fast**.
It can be as fast as a handwritten parser in JavaScript.
Additionally, it is **several times faster** than most other JavaScript parsing libraries.
