# Lexer Modes

Chevrotain supports different lexing rules depending on lexer context.
In essence, this means having multiple separate lexers that can be switched between.

This capability is necessary to tokenize some languages such as HTML.

See [executable example](https://github.com/chevrotain/chevrotain/tree/master/examples/lexer/multi_mode_lexer)
for further details.
