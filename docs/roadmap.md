## RoadMap

#### [Version 1.0](https://github.com/SAP/chevrotain/milestone/4)

The APIs have been pretty stable for a while so Version 1.0 is in the works.
This release will focus on improving the docs, adding a few more example grammars
and minor fixes.

#### Version 2.0
The main focus of version 2.0 will be the addition of **declarative style APIs.**
Either Generator EBNF style API, Combinator Style APIs or even both.

This will transform Chevrotain from being a ECMAScript Parsing DSL to a more general JavaScript Parsing Toolkit/Runtime engine.
