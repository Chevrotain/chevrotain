# Tutorial - Introduction

## Installation

```shell
yarn add chevrotain
# OR
npm install chevrotain
```

## Scenario

In This tutorial we will implement a Parser for a simple SQL Select statement language
That outputs as Abstract Syntax Tree (AST)

## Running & Debugging

The code snippets in the tutorial steps are part of a full
runnable & debugable [example](https://github.com/SAP/chevrotain/tree/master/examples/tutorial).
It is recommanded to use these sources either as a starting template
or as runnable example to gain a deeper understanding.

## Samples Syntax

The tutorial uses ES2015+ syntax.
See examples of using Chevrotain in other [implementation languages](https://github.com/SAP/chevrotain/tree/master/examples/implementation_languages).
