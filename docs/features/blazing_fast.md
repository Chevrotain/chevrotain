# Blazing Fast

Chevrotain treats performance as a feature, not as a secondary concern.
This means that a great deal of work has gone into profiling and optimization with a focus on the [V8 JavaScript engine](https://github.com/v8/v8/wiki).
It also means that new features are also considered in terms of performance cost.

The result of this work is that Chevrotain is **Blazing Fast** it is **several times faster** than most other
JavaScript parsing libraries and can even be one **order of magnitude faster** than some popular ones.

See results of the [performance benchmark](https://sap.github.io/chevrotain/performance/) on Chrome 67 (V8 6.7.288.46):
