**Chevrotain** is a [**very fast**][benchmark] and **feature rich** **Parser Building Toolkit** for **JavaScript**.
It can be used to build parsers/compilers/interpreters for various use cases ranging from simple configuration files,
to full fledged programing languages.

A more in depth description of Chevrotain can be found in this great article on:
[Parsing in JavaScript: Tools and Libraries](https://tomassetti.me/parsing-in-javascript/#chevrotain).

It is important to note that Chevrotain is **NOT** a parser generator.
It solves the same kind of problems as a parser generator, just **without any code generation**.
Chevrotain Grammars are **pure code** which can be created/debugged/edited
as any other pure code without requiring any new tools or processes.
