## Common Prefix Ambiguities

Imagine the following grammar:

```antlr
myRule:
  "A" "B" |
  "A" "B" "C"
```

The first alternative is a prefix of the second alternative.
Now lets consider the input ["A", "B"].
For this input the first alternative would be matched as expected.

However for the input ["A", "B", "C"] the first
alternative would still be matched but this time **incorrectly**
as alternation matches are attempted **in order**.

There are two ways to resolve this:

*   Reorder the alternatives so that shorter common prefix lookahead
    paths appears after the longer ones.

    ```antlr
    myRule:
      "A" "B" "C" |
      "A" "B"
    ```

*   Refactor the grammar to extract common prefixes.

    ```antlr
      myRule:
        "A" "B" ("C")?
    ```
