# Resolving Grammar Errors

## Common Prefix Ambiguities

Imagine the following grammar:

```antlr
myRule:
  "A" "B" |
  "A" "B" "C"
```

The first alternative is a prefix of the second alternative.
Now lets consider the input ["A", "B"].
For this input the first alternative would be matched as expected.

However for the input ["A", "B", "C"] the first
alternative would still be matched but this time **incorrectly**
as alternation matches are attempted **in order**.

There are two ways to resolve this:

-   Reorder the alternatives so that shorter common prefix lookahead
    paths appears after the longer ones.

    ```antlr
    myRule:
      "A" "B" "C" |
      "A" "B"
    ```

-   Refactor the grammar to extract common prefixes.

    ```antlr
      myRule:
        "A" "B" ("C")?
    ```

## Terminal Token Name Not Found

This error occurs when Chevrotain cannot find a TokenType used in a CONSUME call.
Note that Chevrotain identifies the TokenType **literally** that is to say
Chevrotain **reads** the parser's source code (static analysis) not the value at runtime.

Keeping this property in mind lets look at a few common causes of such an error
This parser

-   The TokenType's name does not match its literal form.

    ```javascript
    import { createToken, Parser } from "chevrotain"

    // note the name property "copyPastaMistake" is different that the variable name "Integer"
    const Integer = createToken({ name: "copyPastaMistake", pattern: /\d+/ })
    const allTokens = [Integer]

    class MyParser extends Parser {
        constructor(input, config) {
            super(input, allTokens, config)

            $.RULE("MyRule", () => {
                // Will cause "Terminal Token Name Not Found"
                this.CONSUME(Integer)
            })
        }
    }
    ```

-   The TokenType's was not provided to the parser in the tokenDictionary argument.

    ```javascript
    import { createToken, Parser } from "chevrotain"

    const Integer = createToken({ name: "Integer", pattern: /\d+/ })
    // Opps we forgot to add the Integer Token to the TokenDictionary
    const allTokens = []

    class MyParser extends Parser {
        constructor(input, config) {
            super(input, allTokens, config)

            $.RULE("MyRule", () => {
                // Will cause "Terminal Token Name Not Found"
                this.CONSUME(Integer)
            })
        }
    }
    ```

-   This error may also occur due to source code transformations of the parser.
    See: [Minification](http://sap.github.io/chevrotain/docs/FAQ.html#MINIFIED)
    and [Webpack](http://sap.github.io/chevrotain/docs/FAQ.html#WEBPACK) FAQ sections.

    Basically if a code snippet such as:

    ```javascript
    const Integer = createToken({ name: "Integer", pattern: /\d+/ })
    // ...
    this.CONSUME(Integer)
    ```

    gets transformed to something like

    ```javascript
    const v14 = createToken({ name: "Integer", pattern: /\d+/ })
    // ...
    this.CONSUME(v14)
    ```

    Then the literal form no longer matches the name property...
