In a <strong>real world</strong> scenario the difference will be smaller as the regular parser will have semantics (CST creation / embedded actions). Those semantics have their own runtime cost while the content assist parser will <strong>always</strong> remain a pure grammar.</p></li><li><p><strong>Smart beats fast</strong>: Content Assist is normally used in a code editor. A code editor should be by definition <strong>incremental</strong> as it does not matter how smart the error recovery is or how fast the parser, re-parsing a whole file for every single changed character will simply <strong>not scale</strong>, both from a performance perspective and from the requirement of handling partially invalid inputs. What this means is that if a code editor is already (as it should be) incremental. It could invoke the call to <strong>computeContentAssist</strong> on a subset of the input as well. This subset could easily be <strong>several</strong> orders of magnitudes smaller, thus all performance concerns are resolved.</p><ul><li><p>Example: Imagine a 1,000 lines JavaScript file where a single 10 lines function is being edited and content assist is requested inside that small function.</p><div class="language-javascript ext-js line-numbers-mode"><pre class="language-javascript"><code><span class="token comment">// line 1</span>

Error recovery can help with invalid inputs by performing small automatic fixes to the input and more often by completely skipping (re-syncing) parts of the input until a &quot;valid&quot; section is encountered.</p><p>The problem is that usually the code area where content assist is requested is also currently being <strong>heavily</strong> modified by the user and is unlikely to able to be successfully parsed or automatically recovered(fixed), instead it will probably be skipped (re-synced) entirely.</p><p>What this means is that for input areas that are currently being edited (or even written from scratch) by the user semantic actions and error recovery are less relevant anyhow. And if as described in the previous section an incremental approach to using the content assist will also resolve the issue in which the content assist position follows a syntax error.</p><p>Example:</p><div class="language-javascript ext-js line-numbers-mode"><pre class="language-javascript"><code><span class="token keyword">let</span> three <span class="token operator">=</span> <span class="token comment">// syntax error, missing expression</span>

It disregards the max token lookahead constraints of the base Chevrotain parser. Therefore, for a grammar path that has been disabled by a Gate / Predicate to be offered as content assist suggestion: Not only does the fixed tokens lookahead have to match at the Gate&#39;s position. The <strong>remaining input</strong> following the Gate&#39;s position must <strong>also</strong> match.
