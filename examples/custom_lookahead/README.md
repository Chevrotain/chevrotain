# examples_custom_lookahead

Example how to use custom lookahead functions to handle grammars that are LL(>1),
or to implement predicates/gates in the grammar.

* [Lookahead > 1](large_lookahead.js)

* [Predicate/Gate](-- RELATIVE MD Link???)

To run the tests for these examples:
* ```npm update``` (only once)
* ```npm test```
