### Using Serialized Chevrotain Grammars.

Starting with version 3.6, Chevrotain allows parsers to be instantiated with
a previously serialized grammar. This is useful because it allows for safe
minification without worrying about name mangling and may even provide cold
start peformance benefits. However, you must make sure your code is using
up-to-date serializations of your parsers.

#### Runnable Example

[gen_serialized](./gen_serialized.js) implements serialization of a sample grammar.
Sample grammar: [grammar.js][./grammar.js].
Additionally [unit tests](./serialized_spec.js) are included to validate the grammars actually work.

To run the serialization and the tests (from parent directory):

-   `node ./serialized_grammar/gen_serialized.js`
-   `./node_modules/.bin/mocha serialized_grammar/serialized_spec.js`
