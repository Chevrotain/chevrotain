# Custom APIs Examples

Chevrotain can be used as the underlying engine to create other **general purpose** parsing libraries.
See: [detailed documentation](https://sap.github.io/chevrotain/website/Deep_Dive/custom_apis.html).

To run the tests for all the tutorial parts:
* ```npm install``` (only once)
* ```npm test```
