# Custom APIs Examples

Chevrotain can be used as the underlying engine to create other **general purpose** parsing libraries.
See: [detailed documentation](https://sap.github.io/chevrotain/docs/guide/custom_apis.html).

To run the tests for all the tutorial parts:

*   `npm install` (only once)
*   `npm test`
